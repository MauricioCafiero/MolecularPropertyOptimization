calculate_SAS_and_NP(smiles_list: list[str]) -> str: Calculates the SAS and NP scores for a list of SMILES strings. 
SAS score is a measure of synthetic accessibility, and a value of 1 indicates that the molecule is easy to synthesize, 
while a value of 10 indicates that it is difficult to synthesize. NP score is a measure of natural product-likeness, 
and a higher score indicates that the molecule is more similar to natural products; the score runs from -5 to 5, with higher scores 
indicating greater similarity to natural products. Should be called for promising molecules with good docking scores and
good Lipinski Properties.

dock_and_get_interacting_residues(smiles: str) -> str: Returns the docking score and types of interactions between a docked molecule and
residues in the target protein. To be used to evaluate whether or not a promising molecule is docked to the expected binding site.
Not to be used until a molecule unless a molecule has been deemed to have a low docking score and  good Lipinsky properties.
